Bicoloring (BFS) — Problem Analysis & Solution
📘 Problem: Graph Bicoloring
Can a graph be colored using only two colors, such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color?
In other words, we must determine whether the graph is bicolorable.

This is the same as checking whether the graph is a bipartite graph.

🎯 Core Concept: Bipartite Graph
A graph is bipartite if:

Its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets (Set A and Set B)
Every edge connects a vertex from Set A to Set B
No edge exists between vertices of the same set
A bipartite graph can always be colored using two colors (e.g., White and Black).

🚫 When is Bicoloring NOT Possible?
Bicoloring is not possible if the graph contains an:

🔺 Odd-Length Cycle
Example:
A triangle (3-cycle) cannot be bicolored because:

If Node 1 = White
Node 2 = Black
Node 3 must be White
But Node 3 is adjacent to Node 1 → ❌ conflict
So the graph becomes NOT BICOLORABLE.

🔍 Solution Approach: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
We use BFS to traverse the graph and try to assign alternating colors (0 and 1) to each node.

✔ Steps of the Algorithm
Initialization

All nodes are marked as uncolored (-1).
Start BFS

Begin from node 0
Assign color 0
Push it into the queue
Coloring during BFS
For each node u popped from the queue:

Each neighbor v should get opposite color = 1 - color[u]
Conflict Check
If any neighbor v already has the same color as u →
➜ Graph contains an odd cycle
➜ NOT BICOLORABLE

If BFS completes without conflict:
➜ BICOLORABLE

💻 Pseudocode
FUNCTION isBicolorable(n, adjList):

    DECLARE colors[n]
    FOR i FROM 0 TO n-1:
        colors[i] = -1   // -1 means Uncolored

    DECLARE queue

    colors[0] = 0       // Start with node 0 having color 0
    queue.push(0)

    WHILE queue is not empty:
        u = queue.pop()
        neighborColor = 1 - colors[u]

        FOR each neighbor v in adjList[u]:

            IF colors[v] == -1:
                colors[v] = neighborColor
                queue.push(v)

            ELSE IF colors[v] == colors[u]:
                RETURN false   // Conflict → Odd cycle detected

    RETURN true
